# Manga-Downloader
Early development of a manga downloader that uses tkinter, BeautifulSoup and  requests. The program currently uses manga reader as its source. Development is currently being done by LorgBorg, an amateur hobbyist. Suggestions are welcome.

Early development contains of 5 phases.
Phase 1: function of the search bar and display of the manga
Phase 2: ability to choose the manga and access it's contents
Phase 3: ability to preview and download the manga
Phase 4: polishing of the graphics
Phase 5: making the GUI a desktop app

after the completion of the 5 phases (to be finished this week). The manga downloader
will be out of early development and will be updated based on user feedback.

The implementation of different sites will not be part of the early development. It is an issue which I am not sure how to handle; I would like to focus on the functionality of the GUI rather than its quality of results.
